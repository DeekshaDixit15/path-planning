Two helper files - intersect.py and graph.py are custom built and provide functions to be used by the algorithms.

Matplotlib is used to draw the figures. No external library has been used for the algorithm itself.

There are two implementations of Randomly Exploring Random
Forest Algorithm-
Both use a goal bias of 0.05 and step size of 5.

rrt.py tries to reach the goal after every new vertex is added, and therefore reaches the goal quicker.

rrt_naiive.py keeps expanding the tree till the goal is actually expanded. 

The output format is as specified in the assignment problem statement
